# File Organiser

A simple Python tool to keep folders tidy.  
Give it a folder path and it will create subfolders (Images, Documents, Music, Videos, Others) and move files into the correct category.  
It also has a simulation mode to preview changes before they happen.  

Version 1.0 â€“ basic functionality with OOP structure; improvements and bug fixes will follow in future versions.
